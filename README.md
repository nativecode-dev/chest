# WTF

It's a chest. With TypeScript inside.

Actually, it's a set of tools to manage TypeScript projects, whether they are stand-alone or workspace-based (either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [Lerna](https://lernajs.io).

# What Problems Get Solved

CHEST will...

- Link `@types` dependencies as a `types` array in your `tsconfig.json`, explicitly listing your declaration dependencies.
- Propogate desriptive `package.json` properties down to child projects if using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) workspaces.

# Supported Project Management Tools

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) 1.3.2+
- [Lerna](https://lernajs.io) 2.0+
